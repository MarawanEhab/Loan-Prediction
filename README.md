# Loan Eligibility Prediction 🚀

## Dataset Story 📊
This dataset contains demographic and loan-related information of customers from a bank. It includes various features that describe the customers' profiles and their loan application details. The primary objective of this dataset is to predict loan eligibility. Predicting loan eligibility is crucial for banks to minimize risk and optimize their lending process. By analyzing this dataset, we can develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer is eligible for a loan based on different factors, which is valuable for the bank's loan approval process.

## Business Problem 💼
The business problem is to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a bank customer is eligible for a loan or not. This prediction can help the bank in implementing targeted strategies to approve or reject loan applications, thereby reducing the risk of default and improving customer satisfaction. Understanding and predicting loan eligibility will enable the bank to make informed decisions and maintain financial stability. 🌟

## Project Steps 🛠️
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔍
Analyze the distribution and relationships of features in the dataset.
Visualize the data to understand the underlying patterns and correlations.
Handle missing values, outliers, and perform necessary data transformations to ensure data quality.

## Feature Engineering 🔧
Encode categorical features to make them suitable for machine learning algorithms.
Scale numerical features for better model performance.
Address any imbalanced data issues to ensure robust model training.

## Model Building 🤖
Build and evaluate different machine learning models to predict loan eligibility:

Logistic Regression
LightGBM (LGBM)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest (optional)
XGBoost (optional)
Stacking Ensemble (optional)

## Model Evaluation 📈
Assess the performance of each model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Select the best-performing model for deployment, ensuring it provides accurate and reliable predictions.

## By following these steps, we aim to create a powerful tool for the bank to accurately determine loan eligibility, ultimately driving better business outcomes. 🌟💼
